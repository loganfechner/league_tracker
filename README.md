# league_tracker
personal league tracker
currently tracks how many level 7 champions you have plus how many tokens you have.
Will tell you which champs you need to get tokens for to get level 7

to initialize the program you must currently enter in all the champs you have level 7(luckily for Ian that number is 0) into the complete_champs.txt copy the formatting of how my champions were entered. You must also enter in the champions you have mastery tokens with in their respective files
